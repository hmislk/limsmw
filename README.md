# oHMIS LIMS Middleware

This middleware serves as a connector between OpenHMIS LIMS and analyzers. It provides support for HL7 and ASTM protocols, and can establish connections through TCP/IP and serial port. It supports both server and client modes, allowing bidirectional communication between the systems. As the number of analyzers that the middleware supports is expected to increase, new additions to the list of supported devices are anticipated. The middleware currently supports Dimention biochemistry analyzer and Sysmax Five part haematology analyzer.

## Title
The Middleware for the Open Source Hospital Management Information System

## Description
This middleware enables analyzers to connect to HMIS API through a RESTful service.

## History
Dr. M.H.B. Ariyaratne, a medical doctor, developed an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) System for his general practice in 2004 using Microsoft Visual Basic 6 and MS-Access. As more doctors began to use the EMR, they requested that he share the system with them. This led to the systematic incorporation of new modules and features into the system, including those needed by doctors who were running clinical laboratories, medical channelling centres, and hospitals.

In 2012, Dr. Ariyaratne initiated a new JavaEE-based Open Source Initiative, which was hosted on GitHub under the MIT license. The Sri Lanka Institute of Advanced Technical Education at Labuduwa, Galle, provided support for the project through their Higher National Diploma in Information Technology (HNDIT) programme, facilitated by Mr. K.M.G.T.R. Waidyarathne, a lecturer in the Department of Information Technology. Some of the students who worked on the project continued to contribute to it after their graduation, with financial support from Dr. Ariyaratne. Commercial support was also provided for installations, user training, maintenance, cloud hosting, and troubleshooting.

## Installation
The installation process is straightforward. Clone the project using git and open it with Visual Studio.

## Usage
A list of supported analyzers can be found on the wiki of the HMIS project.
